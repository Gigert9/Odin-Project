    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>This page is located in a directory called '<em>pages</em>', but we want to reference a photo stored in a directory called '<em>images</em>'. To do so, we need to use a relative path that will take us to the parent directory first, like this: <em>"../images/dog.jpg"</em>:</p>
    <img src="../images/dog.jpg" alt="A picture of a dog" height="310" width="300">
